# Deployment Guide

This project is suitable for a split deployment:

- Backend: Render Web Service running FastAPI.
- Frontend: MilesWeb shared hosting as static files under `public_html` or a subdirectory.

## Backend on Render

Create a new Render Web Service from the repository.

Recommended settings:

- Root directory: `backend`
- Runtime: Python, pinned by `backend/runtime.txt` to Python 3.11
- Build command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Start command: `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`

You may also use the repository `render.yaml` blueprint.

### Render Environment Variables

| Key | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes | Use Render PostgreSQL, Supabase, Aiven, or another managed PostgreSQL URL. SQLite is not recommended on Render because the filesystem is ephemeral. |
| `CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS` | Yes | Your MilesWeb frontend origin, for example `https://sathishkannan.com` or `https://www.sathishkannan.com`. Use comma-separated origins if needed. |
| `AUTH_SECRET_KEY` | Yes | Random secret used to sign lightweight bearer tokens. Generate a long unique value for Render. |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | Optional | Enables live AI briefing. Without it, the app shows a graceful AI-unavailable message. |
| `NEWS_API_KEY` | Optional | Enables fallback NewsData.io ingestion. RSS still works without it. |
| `AI_MODEL_NAME` | Optional | Defaults to `google/gemma-3-27b-it:free`. |

After deploy, verify:

- `https://your-render-service.onrender.com/`
- `https://your-render-service.onrender.com/docs`
- `https://your-render-service.onrender.com/reference/stocks`

## Frontend on MilesWeb PHP-MySQL Hosting

The frontend does not require PHP or MySQL. It is static HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSON data.

Upload the contents of `frontend/` to the target web root, usually one of:

- `public_html/`
- `public_html/finreview/`
- another subdomain document root

Before uploading, set the backend URL through a runtime config file instead of hardcoding it in Git:

1. Copy `frontend/config.runtime.example.php` to `frontend/config.runtime.php`.
2. Set `FINREVIEW_API_URL` in MilesWeb/cPanel/server environment to your Render backend origin, for example `https://your-render-service.onrender.com`.
3. Add this line before `config.js` in the hosted `index.html`:

```html
<script src="config.runtime.php"></script>
```

`frontend/config.runtime.php` is ignored by Git. `frontend/config.js` will use the runtime value when present and fall back to `http://localhost:8000` for local development.

The backend URL is still visible in browser developer tools because the browser must know where to send API requests. Treat API keys, database URLs, and secrets as private; treat the public API origin as configuration, not a secret.

## No Separate Staging Required

For a portfolio project, a separate staging stack is optional. A practical release flow is enough:

1. Deploy backend to Render.
2. Confirm `/docs` opens.
3. Upload frontend to MilesWeb.
4. Register a fresh account.
5. Load sample portfolio.
6. Verify dashboard, portfolio, analytics, alerts, AI briefing, and CSV import.

## Production Notes

- Keep `.env` and database URLs out of GitHub.
- Use PostgreSQL for Render.
- Set `CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS` to the exact MilesWeb domain.
- Render free instances may sleep, so first API request can be slow.
- If using a custom domain for Render, update both `FINREVIEW_API_URL` and CORS.
