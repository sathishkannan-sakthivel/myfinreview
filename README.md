FinReview is an open-source **Community Edition** portfolio intelligence platform designed to demonstrate modern backend architecture, financial analytics, and responsible AI integration.

Unlike traditional portfolio trackers that primarily record transactions, FinReview focuses on helping investors understand **what their portfolio is doing** through deterministic financial analytics complemented by AI-assisted portfolio briefings.

This project is published as a **software engineering showcase**, demonstrating backend engineering, solution architecture, REST API design, financial domain modelling, and AI integration.

# Why FinReview?

Most portfolio trackers focus on recording transactions.

FinReview focuses on helping investors understand **what their portfolio is doing** by combining deterministic financial analytics with AI-assisted portfolio intelligence.

The project was intentionally designed using a **Static Frontend + FastAPI Backend** architecture to demonstrate scalable backend engineering, clean API design, and responsible AI integration while remaining simple to deploy on low-cost infrastructure.

Rather than relying on AI for financial calculations, FinReview keeps all portfolio analytics deterministic and uses AI only to:

- Explain portfolio behaviour
- Summarise market developments
- Highlight portfolio observations
- Generate informational briefings

This separation improves reliability, transparency, and testability while demonstrating responsible AI integration.

# 🏗 Design Principles

FinReview was intentionally designed around a few core engineering principles.

### Deterministic Before AI

Financial calculations are performed using deterministic algorithms.

AI is used only to explain results—not generate them.

---

### Backend-First Architecture

Business logic resides entirely within the FastAPI backend while the frontend remains lightweight, framework-independent, and deployment-friendly.

---

### Responsible AI Integration

AI-generated content is clearly identified as informational and is never presented as investment advice.

---

### Deployment Simplicity

The application is intentionally designed to run using a static frontend and independently hosted backend, making deployment straightforward on low-cost infrastructure.

---

### Open Architecture

The Community Edition exposes the complete application architecture without artificial feature restrictions, making it suitable for learning, evaluation, and portfolio review.
